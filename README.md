Report Samples
=======

### Basic Embed

Try it:

<b>[Simple report rendering], [from a list]</b>

Initialization of the visualize.js library with simple rendering of an HTML report using plain text authentication. See full authentication samples in this guide for securing data and reports with the JasperReports Server and Visualize.js.

>You can easily change the resource to embed a different report from the JasperReport Server.

>For example:

``` javascript
        resource: "/public/Samples/Reports/SalesByMonthReport"
``` 

Try it:

<b>[Load multiple reports]</b>

Use a common configuration to load multiple reports.

### Pagination

Try it:

<b>[Next/previous]</b>, <b>[enter range]</b>, <b>[pagination events]</b>

Provide control for report pagination with either individual selectors or a directly inputed range. Also, see pagination with events for full control of inputs.

Try it:

<b>[Anchors]</b>, <b>[range with anchor]</b>, <b>[anchor and page search]</b>

Provide the ability to move quickly through reports with direct page anchors. Also see an anchor with a range of rendered pages and an example of searching both an anchor and page/range with an event to callout the current selection.

### Custom Input Controls

Try it:

<b>[Paramater passing]</b>, <b>[basic drop-down]</b>, <b>[render values]</b>

Pass a simple set of hard-coded parameters to control report output. This can be expanded with custom inputs controls such as a drop-down. In addition, input control values can be rendered directly from the JasperReport Server.

>Try: A hard coded or dynamic variable...

``` javascript
      inputSelection = "Non-Consumable"
``` 

>for parameter control...

``` javascript
      "ProductFamily": ["Food", inputSelection]
```

Try it:

<b>[Dynamic resource types]</b>

Discover reporting resources available and formats from the JasperReport Server for use with input controls.

### Hyperlinks

Try it:

<b>[Basic drill-down]</b>

Simple parameter passing from one report to another.

### Events

Try it:

<b>[Page totals]</b>, <b>[report status]</b>

Listen through events for a change in the page totals and report completed status.


### Authentication

Try it:

<b>[Basic login/logout]</b>

Simple plain text authentication with demonstration of destroying session with reports.

Try it:

<b>[Secure token authentication]</b>

Token based authentication and initialization of the visualize.js library with a list of reports. 

[JRS - Authentication Cookbook >][Cookbook]

>*Note: Proper authentication needs to be set up with the JasperReport Server and SSO before using token based authentication. View the [Authentication Cookbook] for details on configuring authentication correctly.*

Try it:

<b>[Login/logout with hooks]</b>

Authenticate and destroy the session with the method of your choice through the hooks that are made available through Visualize.js.

Try it:

<b>[Login/logout UI]</b>

A sample UI providing users full authentication options to the JasperReport Server.
